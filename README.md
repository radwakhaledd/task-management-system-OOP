# task-management-system-OOP
implementation of task management system using Binary Search Tree (BST) and Heap data structures in C++ code
This code implements a task management system using Binary Search Tree (BST) and Heap data structures. The program allows users to manage tasks by inserting, searching, removing, and marking tasks as completed. It also provides options to display tasks based on various criteria and generates reports on completed tasks per category.

File Structure:

BST.h: Header file for the Binary Search Tree class.
heap.h: Header file for the Heap class.
main.cpp: Main source code file containing the implementation.
Usage:

Compile the code with a C++ compiler.
Run the executable file generated after compilation.
Follow the on-screen menu prompts to interact with the task management system.
Functionality:

Insert a Task:

Users can add tasks with descriptions, durations, and categories.
Display All Tasks:

Shows all tasks currently in the system.
Search for a Task:

Searches for tasks based on their durations.
Remove a Task:

Removes tasks based on their durations.
Display Tasks with Duration More Than:

Shows tasks with durations greater than a specified value.
Display Tasks with Duration Less Than:

Shows tasks with durations less than a specified value.
Mark Task as Completed:

Allows marking a task as completed by providing its duration and description.
Display Completed Tasks and Category Report:

Displays all completed tasks and generates a report on the number of tasks completed per category.
Exit:

Terminates the program.
Data Input:

The program can read task data from a text file. The file should contain task details such as description, duration, and category in a specified format.
Note:

Ensure the text file format complies with the program's input requirements.
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system effectively.
